# DDrad

 DDrad is a my own version of the Dance Dance Revolution game, made in javascript to play on the go. User will select a song. A certain number of arrows that represent dance moves will appear on the screen. 
 
 The user must press the corresponding key on the keyboard in a timely manner (matching the beat/tempo of the song) in order to earn some points. The user loses a portion of his health bar when failing on pressing the correct key. 
 
 The game ends when the song ends or when the user health bar is empty.
